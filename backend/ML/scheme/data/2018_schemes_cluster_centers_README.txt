Cluster Centers for 2018 - RELATIVE TO MEAN
==============================================

The first column 'cluster' is the cluster ID (0, 1, 2, 3). Each row is that cluster's center.

Feature values show how each cluster differs from the league average for that year.
- Positive values = above average
- Negative values = below average
- Zero = exactly at league average

To get absolute values, add the mean for each feature:
  shotgun_rate: mean = 51.20
  no_huddle_rate: mean = 6.18
  play_action_rate: mean = 0.00
  air_yards_per_att: mean = 7.53
  motion_rate: mean = 0.00
  under_center_rate: mean = 48.80
  under_center_play_action_rate: mean = 0.00
  under_center_pass_rate: mean = 32.33
  under_center_run_rate: mean = 67.67
  shotgun_play_action_rate: mean = 0.00
  shotgun_pass_rate: mean = 75.69
  shotgun_run_rate: mean = 24.31
  down_1_pass_rate: mean = 50.15
  down_1_run_rate: mean = 49.85
  down_2_pass_rate: mean = 58.93
  down_2_run_rate: mean = 41.07
  down_3_pass_rate: mean = 78.26
  down_3_run_rate: mean = 21.74
  read_option_rate: mean = 0.00
